            <h2>Why do people build custom motorcycles?
                Some people say: if I have to explain, u wouldnt understand…
                But Ok, there is at least one obvius answer: they do it so they can have a custom motorcycle.
                But if all u wanted was own a custom motorcycle,there are easier ways to get one…
                Come to my garage.

                Custom Culture
                <br>
                <br>
                Biking, at least according to the usual boilerplate, is all about freedom and individuality. Obviously this isn’t entirely true, 
                otherwise there wouldn’t be clubs where everyone owns the same make of bike, but it is still an important factor in their appeal.
                Nevertheless, the urge to stamp your identity onto your bike is strong, and people have been customising their motorcycles, either for 
                performance or appearance, since they were invented. 
                The exact origins of custom bikes are lost in the mists of time, and kind of blur together with the phase of motorcycle history when “owning a bike” 
                usually meant “building one”.
                
                One of the earliest custom motorcycles we know about was built by Harold “Oily” Karslake, an engineer and trails rider who lived at the turn of the 20th century.
                 In 1902 he built a motorcycle, the Dreadnought, which combined the frame and engine from different machines and unique scratch-built components. 
                 Whether or not it was the first custom bike built is impossible to say for sure, but it’s the first one we know about.
                One of the main forces guiding the development of custom bikes was sport. The Dreadnought was built for endurance races, 
                and indeed was still winning into the 1920s, long after it had technically been outclassed. The 1920s saw the emergence of 
                dirt track racing in Australia and America, with many riders adapting road bikes to go faster on rough ground.
                The motorcycles of the first two decades of the 20th century were ergonomically similar to bicycles, with the seating 
                position in the “sit up and beg” posture. This gave them a high centre of gravity which makes handling a tad tricky. Over the 
                years manufacturers began to adapt the shape of bikes, which resulted in a frame that swept diagonally up from the rear wheel incorporating a lower seat.
                It was relatively easy for people to adapt older bikes to this new style, and this saw the emergence of the first style of custom 
                bike widespread enough to garner its own name, the cut down.

                Now we reach the part in any history of motorcycles where we mention the effects of World War 2 on the evolution of biker culture. Although a global phenomenon, 
                in terms of custom motorcycles the main innovations emerged from the United States and Great Britain.
                You know the score: returning soldiers looking for cheap transport, camaraderie and excitement, get motorcycles, form clubs and generally let their hair down 
                after living through the horrors of war. American aficionados had known about the superiority of European motorbikes since before the war – indeed, cut downs 
                and bob-jobs had been an attempt to replicate their performance, and components of British motorcycles had been much sought after for early US customisers.
                Many American soldiers had grown to love the European bikes they had used during the war, and this, coupled with the availability of cheap ex-military 
                motorcycles, saw a huge increase in the number of people customising their rides. Increasingly, aesthetics were just as important as performance, 
                with flamboyant paint jobs becoming more popular. This trend was brought over from the world of custom cars, drawing inspiration from the burgeoning 
                Hot Rod and drag racing scenes.
                Throughout the fifties a new breed of customisers began to develop more radical modifications. Still largely based on Harleys, they drew inspiration 
                from dragster motorcycles, adding in raked forks, swapping in larger wheels and smaller fuel tanks, as well as lashings of chrome. Combined with 
                flamboyant, pin-striped paint jobs, the custom scene was a reflection of the same energy that helped popularise rock and roll. This style became known 
                as Kustom Kulture and its influence can be felt to this day, with the continued popularity of vintage and rockabilly styles being the latest manifestation.
                As the forks got longer and longer, more extreme work was required on the frames to get the bikes to work. Instead of minor cuts and bobs, this new breed 
                required the original bike to be all but completely dismantled, before chopping and reassembling the frame so it could accommodate the extended forks. And 
                thus was born the chopper.
                
                Throughout the 1960s builders pushed the chopper further, with longer forks and more elaborate decorations. The public image of choppers was solidified by 
                the release of the 1969 counter-culture classic Easy Rider, which starred Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper riding two particularly fine choppers that demonstrate 
                exactly how far the customiser’s art had come since the cut-down days.
                
                Modern chopper makers aren’t just sticking bits of bikes together, they’re often making bespoke components from scratch, with 
                the end results being rideable works of art. While they are beautiful pieces of engineering, these high-end custom machines are out of the price range of most riders.
                
                
                Recent years have seen the popularity of custom bikes rise to ever higher levels. This has been helped by shows like American Chopper, 
                which ran for over 160 episodes and has spawned several spin-offs. These bikes represent the high point of chopper making, with end products that 
                look spectacular, but probably spend most of their life looking spectacular in the garage of a millionaire.
